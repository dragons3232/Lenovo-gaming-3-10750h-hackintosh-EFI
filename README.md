I had a hard time to find a working hackintosh EFI for my lenovo gaming 3. I guess some one out there is looking for this. So here we go :))

# Upgrading to Sonoma from Ventura
1. Download **[https://github.com/dragons3232/Lenovo-gaming-3-10750h-hackintosh-EFI/blob/main/EFI Ventura to Sonoma.zip](https://github.com/dragons3232/Lenovo-gaming-3-10750h-hackintosh-EFI/blob/main/EFI%20Ventura%20to%20Sonoma.zip)** and extract it to Volumes/EFI/EFI (This EFI is required to access WIFI to download Sonoma)
2. Download Sonoma from https://apps.apple.com/us/app/macos-sonoma/id6450717509
3. Install Sonoma by following instructions on the screen
4. After successfully updating to Sonoma, download [https://github.com/dragons3232/Lenovo-gaming-3-10750h-hackintosh-EFI/blob/main/EFI Sonoma.zip](https://github.com/dragons3232/Lenovo-gaming-3-10750h-hackintosh-EFI/blob/main/EFI%20Sonoma.zip) and extract it to Volumes/EFI/EFI to overwrite.
